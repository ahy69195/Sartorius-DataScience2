Neuron Cell Segmentation with PyTorch
=====================================

Segmenting neuronal cells from images taken using phase contrast microscopy with a U-Net model built in PyTorch.

- See '.UNet - PyTorch/Cell Segmentation.ipynb' Notebook for full process
- Isolated model components are also there as well (Trying to get num_workers to work for DataLoader)
